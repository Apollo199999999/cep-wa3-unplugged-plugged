                <li>There are two player roles in this game: Saboteurs, and Dwarves.</li>
                <li>Each player has been randomly assigned a role, and they do not know the roles of other players.</li>
                <li>In this game, there are four rooms in total - the main room, where players spawn, and three treasure
                    rooms.</li>
                <li>Only one of the three treasure rooms are real.</li>
                <li>The objective of the Dwarves is to reach the real treasure room before time runs out.</li>
                <li>The objective of the Saboteurs is to prevent the Dwarves from reaching the real treasure room before
                    time runs out.</li>
                <li>If time runs out before the real treasure room is found, the Saboteurs win.</li>
                <li>If any player finds the real treasure room, regardless if the player is a Dwarf or a Saboteur, the
                    game automatically ends, and the Dwarves win.</li>
                <li>There is no maxmimum limit on the total number of players in a single room, however, there must be a
                    minimum of four players in a single room for the game to start.</li>

            <ul class="list-disc list-outside pl-4 mb-2">
                <li>During the game, both Saboteurs and Dwarves can place the following wall blocks, stone blocks,
                    path blocks, and boundary blocks. There will be a 30 second cooldown after placing 5 blocks
                    (excluding boundary blocks placed). This cooldown can be reduced by purchasing a cooldown reduction
                    from the shop.</li>

                    <p>Wall blocks:
                        These blocks
                        make up the walls of rooms, and can be broken by placing a path block on it.</p>

                        These blocks
                        make up the area between rooms, and can be broken by placing a path block on it.</p>

                    <p>Path blocks:
                        These blocks can be used to dig paths through the stone and wall blocks, as players are allowed
                        to walk on top of these blocks. These blocks make up the floor of the main room.</p>

                        These blocks can be placed by both Saboteurs and Dwarves, but they can never be broken. For this
                        reason, players can only place boundary blocks after purchasing boundary blocks at the shop
                        using coins.</p>

                <li>During the game, players can purchase abilities and buffs using coins through the shop by walking up
                    to the shop
                    and clicking on the "Examine" button. The shop can be seen below:

                <li>
                    Players can obtain coins from coin spawners located at both corners of the main room. Coins can be
                    used to purchase items from the shop, and coin spawning rates can be increased by solving puzzles.
                    Each coin spawner can only contain a maximum of 6 coins at any one time to reduce lag, hence coins
                    must first be collected from the spawners for more coins to spawn.
                    Coins can be collected from the spawners by simply walking up to the coins.

                <li>
                    Two puzzles are available for players to solve in the main room, which will increase coin spawning
                    rates. The exact increase in coin spawning rates depends on the puzzle solved, and is stated at the
                    top of every puzzle. Once a player has solved a puzzle, they cannot solve that puzzle again,
                    however, other players can still solve that puzzle. To solve a puzzle, walk up to that puzzle and
                    click the "Examine" button.
